# Historical-Stock-Data-Analysis
This is my final assignment submission for the IBM Python Project for Data Science, which is a part of the Professional Data Analyst Certificate course series.
In this project, I have made use of libraries like yFinance, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, etc. to extract stock data of Tesla and GameStop.
The data has been cleaned and modified to be suitable for data visualisation.
